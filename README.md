## LONG ROAD AHEAD ! IT'S FAR FROM FINISH ! WALKING THE MAZE !

Finnaly I have started my journey in <strong>Game Development</strong>.<break>
After weeks comparing various game engines and lurking on streamers & youtubers, my love is fallin into [Godot 4.2](https://godotengine.org/ "Free & Opensource Game Engine") with C# script.
C# is rich with mature framework,pattern and lib packages, so why not implementing those in this one.

## What I have learn 
- **Game Engine** : Why Godot ? Well it's Open Source & 100% FREE, this is so far <strong>"The Most Newbie Friendly"</strong> with intuitive  ui workflow. And after Unity decided to changes their Pricing License,  Godot is the best option for Indie GameDev for sure !
- **Sprite/Pixel Art Tool** : Its lot of tools for Sprite Image Editor out there, but i think [aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). It's simple yet powerfully equiped with various Plugins.
- **Animation** : Use AnimationPlayer with Spreadsheet (.png) containing all animation frames for complex animation but start with AnimatedSprite2D 
- **Components Base Project** : Its important for scaling and easy to maintenance
